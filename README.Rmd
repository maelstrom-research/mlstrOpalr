The goal of mlstrOpalr is to provide functions to support compatibility between
Maelstrom R packages and Opal environment. Opal is the OBiBa application for 
data management, and Opal environments can be integrated with RStudio 
environments using the package `opalr`. The user must have adequate credentials 
to interact with a specific Opal environment.
Please see [Opal documentation](https://opaldoc.obiba.org/) for complete 
documentation.

# it, and use the exit command quit() to terminate the current R session.
