Description: Functions to support compatibility between 'Maelstrom' R packages 
     and 'Opal' environment. 'Opal' is the 'OBiBa' core database application for 
     biobanks. It is used to build data repositories that integrates data 
     collected from multiple sources. 'Opal Maelstrom' is a specific 
     implementation of this software. This 'Opal' client is specifically 
     designed to interact with 'Opal Maelstrom' distributions to perform 
     operations on the R server side. The user must have adequate credentials.
     Please see <https://opaldoc.obiba.org/> for complete documentation.
